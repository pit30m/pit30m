# Pit30M Development Kit

## Overview
This is the Python software development kit for the Pit30M benchmark for large-scale global localization.

The dataset is not live yet as of November 5th 2022, but we are hard at work getting it ready for release. The devkit software
is in a very early stage and does not yet have true data to read.

In the meantime, consider checking out [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12437). If you would like to, you
could also follow some of the authors' social media, e.g., [Andrei's](https://twitter.com/andreib) in order to be among
the first to hear of any updates!


## Getting Started

To preview some example very early stage data, check out the [tutorial notebook](pit30m/examples/tutorial_00_introduction.ipynb).

More tutorials coming soon.
